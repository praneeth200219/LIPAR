# LIPAR
This is the official implementation of our paper titled: **LIPAR -  Dynamic Person Independent Holistic Visual Speech Recognizer** submitted to review at IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
- Preprocessed and Extracted the Lip RoI from the MIRACL-VC1 dataset using the state-of-the-art preprocessing techniques. 
- A novel 3D Deep learning framework is proposed for estimating the word spoken from the userâ€™s videotape.
- Developed an autonomous smart application prototype for edge devices without any manual intervention
